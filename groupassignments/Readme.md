# How can recent California legislation be implemented to create more housing stock and homeownership opportunities for low and moderate income residents of Los Angeles County?
Trong Kim and Sharon Ghalchi

## Proposal 

A link to our proposal can be found [here](https://github.com/trongk/206a-groupproject/tree/main/groupassignments).

## Roles

**Sharon** - *Researcher*
1. An analysis of single family parcels in the City of Los Angeles
2. Cross referencing our data with the location current affordable housing stock as well as areas in need of affordable housing 

**Trong** - *Researcher*
1. An analysis of Smallplexes in the City of Los Angeles
2. Cross checking our research with ADU permit data

## Status Update
We're feeling pretty good right now. Last week we were a little unsure about what jurisdiction we should scale our research to. At first, we were considering LA County, but that would have been too large. Next, we were a little worried about the size of our data, so we tried scaling down to Culver City, but there was not much data available. Finally, we decided to stick with the City of Los Angeles because data sets are readily available and not too large. 

One thing we are both worried about is how to section off the city to analyze our data. Some data doesn't come with locality information (i.e. zip code or census track) and even when it does, there are so many groupings (i.e. too many zip codes) that analysis can be difficult. We need to figure out how to clump our data to analyze it. 

## Data Update
We have already listed most of our data in our proposal. We have added Building and Safety Permit Information data for LA which can be found [here](https://data.lacity.org/City-Infrastructure-Service-Requests/Building-and-Safety-Permit-Information-Old/yv23-pmwf/data) which Trong analyzed this week in his individual assignment. Sharon analyzed the City of LA zoning data source we listed in our proposal during this weeks individual assignment. 

## Concerns
**Major Concerns**
1. How to decrease data size
2. How to overlay data
3. How to map data that is not geospatial but has latitude and longitude coordinates
4. How to add jurisdiction data to geospatial data sources that do not already have it 
5. How to make different data sets uniform.

**Minor Concerns**
1. Are we moving the right direction? 
2. What should we work on next? What should our timeline be? 
3. Is our scope to big or too small?
