    "For our group project, my team is researching the potential impact that SB8, SB9, and SB10 can make on the supply of new housing in the City of Los Angeles. One of our primary data sources will highlight existing single-famiy zoning conditions in the City of Los Angeles. This data source will highlight areas in which ADUs and smallplexes are permitted to be constructed. The zoning information for the City of Los Angeles can be found [here](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/zoning/explore?location=34.055956%2C-118.234564%2C12.90). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in this notebook,we will be filtering the zoning information of the City of Los Angeles and running a spatial autocorrelation analysis to understand which neighborhoods in Los Angeles have the highest percentage/concentration of single family zones. We will use the LA Times neighborhood boundary as our location index. "
